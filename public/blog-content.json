Welcome to my first blog post!\nI don't actually think this page will become a blog, rather just place where I periodically place a cool picture I took and my insights on it. Or just not used at all since I am not really a blogger or anything like that. It might just become my testing site for new featues with the glass cards as well... Anyways thanks for reading!"

I might hook the data that is been shown here into a database if I am going to be writing here often but I am still not sure yet about that, so we will see.\nThere is still some issues/features that I might need to implement such as having images not always on the side of the card, and such. Anyways, I will update you guys here later!\n\n-E.C"
